# Laplace-Theorem
A simple program in go that will be able to calculate the matrix determinant by using the Laplace Theorem.

## Features
- It will calculate square matrices from 2 to 4 rows of size.

## Project Structure
- `Laplace Theorem` (main folder), where the following files are located:
  - `laplace.go`, where you find the main functions of the library,
  - `laplace_test.go`, containing all test functions of the library,
  - `types.go`, containing all the custom types used,
  - `readme.md` and `license`.


## How to use it
### Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/Gabri432/Laplace-Theorem.git
